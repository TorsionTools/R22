Autodesk Revit 2020 - 2022 API Visual Studio Solution Template with Code Examples for Common Tools

The intent of the repository is to help provide REVIT API support and to share code examples and solutions for common issues or time consuming tasks in Revit.
I will provide examples and tools of items as I have created and use them, and then other are free to manipulate them to fit how they need them to work, but without any expressed or implied warranty and/or guarantee of functionality or errors.
I think this will be the best way to share some of the work I have done without having to create installers for every single tool or publishing everything to the Autodesk App Store.
